*How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 
What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I used clear function names, consistent formatting, and modular code. 
The CRUD Python module made it easy to reuse code across projects—connecting the dashboard widgets in Project Two was simpler and less error-prone.
In the future, I could use this module to support new features or other interfaces without rewriting database logic.

*How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? 
When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I begin by breaking it down into clear, manageable components and selecting the most appropriate tools to address each part. 
For the Grazioso Salvare project, I was new to MongoDB, so I adopted a thoughtful, research-focused approach—frequently consulting documentation to ensure proper usage of its functions.
This project differed from previous coursework in that it required greater independence and exploration of unfamiliar technologies. 
Moving forward, I plan to continue applying careful planning and in-depth research to develop database solutions tailored to each client's unique requirements.


*What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists create software solutions that help organizations work more efficiently and make better decisions. My work on this type of project, which was building
a database and interactive dashboard could help companies access and visualize important data in real time, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy. 
This kind of tool can streamline workflows, support faster decision-making, and be adapted for use by similar organizations in need of data-driven solutions.
